Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering applies engineering principles, methods and tools to develop, maintain high quality software systems. 
it's importance in the technology industry includes making teams work efficiently, budget well for projects and provides good ways to manage projects.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
developing- doing it from the start.
maintenance- making sure that the software is up to date
deployment- this involves rolling out solutions for others


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
analysis- during this stage, you add and incorporatre specific data to the system.
testing- this stage ensures that the application's features are working correctly and that they fulfill the expectations and objectives.
deployment- this is the phase that involves rolling out solutions for others
maintenance- this implies making sure that the software is up to date


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall requires one to complete one project before phase before moving to the next phase while Agile allows one to work simultaneously on different phases of the same project. 


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
software developer- to write codes using languages like python and java, to test codes and debug whenever necessary, design and implement efficient softwares.
quality assurance engineer- to make sure that the product is meeting the required quality, to suggest corrections where necessary.
project manager- to manage the projeect's money, to ensure that the stakeholder's are satisfied with the output, to plan and develop the whole project's idea


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDE's are important because they enable programmers develop codes efficiently eg editing, testing and building.VCS enables collaborations by ensuring that many developers work on the same codebase without any conflicts


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
lack of workflow visibility- a developer should aim to understand the project well first and avoid doing things vaguely 
scalability,security and performance challenges- developers shoild aim to define coding standards so that they can have scalable codes. Also, they should use security testing tools for enhanced security.
developer burnout- ro remedy this, a developer can section their work so that they are  aware of what they are working ath what particular time


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
unit testing- during this step, the program is submitted to assessments that focus on specific components to determine whether each component is fully functional. The aim of doing this is to make sure that the application is working as designed.
integration testing- this step allows one to integrate all units and test them together. This helps find the problem between modules.
system testing- happens when the application is complete so that it can be tested as whole. The importancce of this is to make sure that the application has compiled all the oulined requirement.
acceptance testing- this is the final level and this is conducted to determine whether the whole system is ready to use. This is done to ensure that the application met all the requirements.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering refers to creating a special recipe for your robot and the importance of that is that you will get accurate information of what you are looking for.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
"what is software engineering" when intending to get an answer that a six year old can understand. to remedy this, one should use this prompt"by using emojis and pictures, explain what software engineering is to a six year old". the prompt will be more effective because you have given clear instructions.
