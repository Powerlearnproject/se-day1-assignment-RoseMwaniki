Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
software engineering applies enginerring principles , methods and tools to develop, maintain high quality software systems. 
it's importance in the technology industry includes making teams work efficiently, budget well for project.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
developing- doing it from the start
maintenance-making sure that the software is up to date.
deployment- this involves rolling out solutions for others


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
analysis- during this stage, you add and incorporate specific data to the system
testing- this stage ensures that the application's features are working correctly and that they fulfill the expectations of the program
deployment- this is the phase that involves rolling out solutions for others
maintenance-this ensures that the software is up to date


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall requires one to complete one project phase before moving on to the next phase while Agile allows one to work simultaneously on all the phases on the project.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
software developer- to write codes using languges such as python, java script, to write codes and debug whenever necessary
quality assurance engineer-to make sure that the project is meeting the required quality, to suggest corrections where necessary
project manager- to manage the project's money, to ensure that the stakeholdrs are satisfied with the output, to plan and develop the whole project


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDE's are important because they enable programmers develop codes efficiently eg editing. VCS enables collaborations by the same code base without any conflicts.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
lack of workflow visibility- a developer should to understand the project well first and avoid doing things vaguely.
scalability, security and performance challenges- developrs should aim to define coding standards so that they can have scalable codes, also enhanced security
developer burnout- to remedy this, a developer can section their work so that they are aware of what they are working on and at what particular time 


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
unit testing- during this step, the program is submitted to assessments that focus on specific components to determine whether each component is fully functional. This is to make sure that the application is working as designed. 
integration testing- this step allows one to integrate all units and test them together. This helps find the problem between modules. 
system testing-happens when the aplication is complete so that it can be tested as whole . The importance of this is to make sure that the application has compiled all requirements.
accepatance testing- this is the final level and this is conducted to determine whether the whole system is ready to use. This is done to ensure that the application met all the requirements.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
prompt engineering refers to creating a special recipe for your robot. The importance of this is to get high quality reaponses.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
prompting your AI "what is software engineering" with the intention of making a six year od to understand. instead, one should prompt this" using emojis and images, explain what software engineering is to a six year old child"
